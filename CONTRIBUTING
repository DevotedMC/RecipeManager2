To Develop with Eclipse:
1. Fork RecipeManager2: https://github.com/haveric/RecipeManager2 and fork RecipeManagerCommon: https://github.com/haveric/RecipeManagerCommon
2. Setup Eclipse and install the latest java jre and jdk
3. Install "Gradle Integration for Eclipse" from the Eclipse Marketplace

Eclipse setup:
1. Copy the clone url from your forked RecipeManagerCommon. Should look similar to this: https://github.com/UserOrTeamName/RecipeManagerCommon.git
2. Open/Select File->Import->Git->Projects from Git and then click Next
3. Select Clone URI and then click Next
4. The Location information should autofill if you copied the url from step 1
4a. The URI should match step 1
4b. Host should be github.com
4c. Repository path should be similar to UserOrTeamName/RecipeManagerCommon.git
5. (Optional) Fill out Authentication information so you don't have to every time you commit (and select Store in Secure Store)
6. Click Next
7. On the Branch Selection screen, the master branch should already be selected. Click Next
8. On the Local Destination screen, choose the directory to store the local git project (should default to C:\Users\name\git\RecipeManagerCommon)and click Next
9. Leave the imort as "Import existing Eclipse projects" and click Next
10. RecipeManagerCommon should be selected and you can hit finish

11. Repeat steps 1-6 with your forked version of the main project: RecipeManager2
12. In the branch selection of RecipeManager2, there is a master branch and a gh-pages branch. You only need the master branch for development. gh-pages is for website testing which I may be moving in the future
13. On the Local Destination screen, make sure you choose the same base directory that you put RecipeManagerCommon in. (for example: C:\Users\name\git\RecipeManager2 where C:\Users\name\git\ is the base directory)
14. Continue to import the existing project.
15. You should now have two projects in eclipse: RecipeManagerBukkit and RecipeManagerCommon.

To Build RecipeManager:
1. Right click RecipeManagerBukkit and select Gradle->Tasks Quick Launcher
2. Enter "clean build" and make sure the project selected is RecipeManagerBukkit before hitting enter
3. The jar should get created in build/libs/

Syncing a github fork with latest main project changes:
Externally with git installed
Setup Remote for a fork: https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/
Updating the fork: https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

OR in Eclipse:
Setup Remote for a fork:
1. Right click the project. Select Team->Remote->Configure Fetch from Upstream...
2. Click Change... and update the URI to https://github.com/haveric/RecipeManager2.git or https://github.com/haveric/RecipeManagerCommon.git depending on the project
3. The information should all get filled out for the project after copying the URI. Press Finish
3. Click "Add..." Select the Source (master) and click Next and then Finish.
4. Click Save

Updating the fork:
1. Right click the project. Select Team->Fetch from Upstream
2. Right click the project. Select Team->Switch To->master (if not already on master branch)
3. Right click the project. Select Team->Merge...
4. Select Remote Tracking->origin/master (if not already selected)
5. Leave merge and fast forward options set to the top values and click Merge
6. You should get a Fast-Fowards result with any updates. Click OK to finish

To start development on a new feature:
1. Right click the project. Select Team->Switch To->New Branch and select an appropriate name for the branch pertaining to the feature you are working on and then click Finish
2. Create updates, fixes, whatever code you need for your development.
3. If working on multiple features, please use different branches for each feature)
