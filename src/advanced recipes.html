<h1>Advanced Recipes</h1>

If you haven't read the <a href="basic recipes.html">Basic Recipes</a> I suggest you do before reading this tutorial.

In this tutorial we will cover more advanced customization of recipes.

You should first know about argument styles that I'm going to be using in this tutorial.
Arguments enclosed between &lt; and &gt; are required and those enclosed between [ and ] are optional.
Some arguments may have 'or false', that means you can just type false in there to make it do something special (most likely disable the flag or a feature)

<hr><h2>USING FLAGS</h2>

Here's the full syntax of a recipe file:

<div id="code">[@shared or recipe flag]
[... more flags]

&lt;recipe definition&gt; [recipe name]
[@shared or recipe flag]
[... more flags]
&lt;ingredients&gt;
= &lt;result&gt;
  [@shared or result flag]
  [... more flags]
[... more results]

[... more recipes]
</div>


Here's a quick example of the above syntax by using all available options:

<div id="code">@message You crafted this! // this applies to all recipes within this file

COMBINE
@broadcast {player} has crafted a fine sword!

iron_ingot + gold_ingot + diamond:*:2

= gold_sword
  @enchant durability max
  @name Fine Gold Sword
  @lore &gt;gray&lt;This sword has been crafted from pure awesomeness!


CRAFT Some Awesome Recipe
@modexp +1
@message false // disable the file-wide flag on this recipe

apple

= apple

</div>

The spacing is not required as I put it but it's recommended because you can see stuff easier.
