  {flag} <permission or -permission or false>
  
    Makes the recipe or item require the crafter to have a permission.
    This flag can be used more than once to add more permissions, the player must have at least one to allow crafting.
    
    Specifying a permission node with the - prefix would prevent crafting if player has at least one permission.
    
    Using 'false' will remove all previously added permissions for the recipe/result.
    
    Examples:
      {flag} ranks.vip
      {flag} jobs.crafter
      {flag} -ranks.newbs
      {flag} - jobs.warrior  // valid with a space too
      {flag} false
