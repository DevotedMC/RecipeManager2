Information about recipe flags.

First of all: don't worry, you can't break anything, the plugin will tell you when something is done wrong and tips on solving it.
If you can't solve it feel free to ask in a comment: http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/recipemanager/



TODO finish writing this QA style description...

WHAT ARE FLAGS ANYWAYS ?
  Flags make recipes SPECIAL !
  You can add alot of features to a recipe/result by using them.

HOW DOES A FLAG LOOK LIKE ?
  It starts with a @ followed by its name then a space and its value !
  Example: @permission my.awesome.permission

ON WHAT I CAN ADD FLAGS ?
  Flags are divided by 3 categories:
  - Recipe-only
  - Result-only
  - Shared (can be added on recipes and results)
  
WHERE CAN I WRITE FLAGS ?
  Flags can be written in 3 places:
  - At the begining of the file - shared and recipe-only flags only
    Applies the flags to all recipes in the file, recipes may edit their flag list individually
    
  - After recipe's type/definition (CRAFT, COMBINE, etc) - Recipe-only flags (obviously :P)
    They affect the current recipe only and overwrite the file's flags as well !


I LIKE SYNTAXES, SHOW ME ONE !
  Recipe file syntax:
  
  [@flag ...]
  [...]
  
  <RECIPE_DEFINITION>
  [@flag ...]
  [...]
  <INGREDIENTS AND STUFF>
  = <RESULT...>
    [@flag ...]
    [...]




CAN FLAGS CAN BE USED ON RESULTS TOO ?
  Yes!
  Most flags can be used on recipes or results, some flags can be used only on recipes and some flags only on results.
  I've categorized the flags below by "shared", "recipe only" and "results only".

WHERE DO I ACTUALLY WRITE FLAGS ?
  Flags can be added in 3 places:
  - At the begining of the file - shared and recipe-only flags only
    Applies the flags to all recipes in the file, recipes may edit their flag list individually
    
  - After recipe's type/definition (CRAFT, COMBINE, etc) - Recipe-only flags (obviously :P)
    They affect the current recipe only and overwrite the file's flags as well !
    
  - at the begining of the file - which are copied to all recipes from that file, this area only allows shared and recipe-only flags!
  - after recipe type (CRAFT, COMBINE, etc) - where they affect that specific recipe, you may even overwrite file flags for that specific recipe!
  - after recipe's individual results - to apply flags for the result items.

FLAG VALUES/ARGUMENTS
  After the "@flag" definition you set the flag value, that value may consist of one argument, serval arguments or no arguments at all.
  Arguments are usually described with a name and enclosed between something, e.g. <color>
     <arg> means the argunent 'arg' is required.
     [arg] means the argument 'arg' is optional.
  You must place 
  
FLAG VALUE KEYWORDS: "false"
  Most arguments can be disabled/removed with a key word "false".
  You'll see "<arg or false>", that means you can use "false" keyword there.
  This is useful when you have a flag in the file header and you want to remove a specific flag in a specific recipe/result

ALIASES
  They're just other names for the flag that you can use, they have no special effect if used, only for your preference.
