<h1>Basic recipe tutorial</h1>


<b>HOW TO MAKE A RECIPE FILE</b>

  First go to <b>/plugins/RecipeManager/recipes</b> folder and create a file with the <b>.txt</b> extension.
  
  Then you can just open that with an text editor and start writing recipes.


<b>ABOUT RECIPE FILES</b>

  You can have as many recipe files and recipes per file as you want, you can also create folders for organization.
  
  The text in recipe files can be any letter case and can have any amount of spaces, tabs and new lines.
  
  They also support diferent styles of comments: //, /* */ and #


<b>ABOUT DEFINING ITEMS</b>

  Item formats are usually 'material:data' and results are 'material:data:amount'
  - 'material' = name, id or alias (see '<a href="name index.html#material">name index.html</a>' and 'aliases.yml')
  - (optional) 'data' = data name (from 'aliases.yml'), number or * for any data value (default)
  - (optional) 'amount' = number, default 1

  For more advanced settings like name, lore, enchantments, etc, see <a href="recipe flags.html">recipe flags.html</a>


<hr><h2>RECIPE SYNTAXES</h2>


<h3>CRAFT RECIPE - shaped workbench recipe</h3>
<div id="code">CRAFT
material:data + material:data + material:data
material:data + material:data + material:data
material:data + material:data + material:data
= chance% material:data:amount
...</div>
    
  The ingredients are in the shape of the recipe grid, it will also work if horizontally mirroed.
  Number of ingredients is optional, you can specify only 1 or all 9 of them if you want.
  Specifying a square of 4 or smaller makes it work in player's inventory crafting.
  
  As for the result the 'chance%' part is optional and if defined then 'chance' must be a number between 0.0 and 100.0 (yes, accepts decimals)
  The '...' part means that you can repeat the previous statement, so you can define more than one result and the recipe will randomly pick one of the results.
  You can avoid defining the chance number or use *% even to allow it to be calculated.
  You can also add a chance of failure to the recipe by using fail, air or 0 as one of the results.
  
  <b>Examples:</b>
<div id="code">// this is just a comment by the way
// a hoe craftable in player inventory
craft
wood + wood
stick
= wood_hoe

// fragile bowl
craft
stick + wood + stick
air + stick
= bowl // undefined chance, will be calculated
= 25% fail // 'fail' is alias for air, but will make the recipe fail, yes.</div>



<h3>COMBINE RECIPE - shapeless workbench recipe</h3>
<div id="code">COMBINE
material:data:amount + ...
= chance% material:data:amount
...</div>

  Unlike shaped recipe, this recipe's ingredients can be placed in any order anywhere on the grid.
  You can specify up to 9 items added up.
  
  This recipe alkso supports multiple results just like shaped recipe, read above for information. 

  <b>Examples:</b>
<div id="code">// 3 sulphur + 2 sand = 2 TNT
combine
sulphur:*:3 + sand + sand
= TNT:0:2

// smash 2 diamonds and pray for something good
combine
diamond + diamond
= 0.1% diamond:0:32
= coal:0:4 // let it calculate the chance evenly for this and the next two
= iron_ingot
= gold_ingot
= 75% fail</div>


<h3>SMELT RECIPE - furnace smelting recipe</h3>
<div id="code">SMELT
material:data % time
&amp; material:data
= material:data:amount</div>


  The first 'material:data' is the ingredient.
  (optional) '% time' can be the time to smelt, 'time' should be a 'instant', a float number or a range of float numbers separated by a dash.
  (optional) '&amp; material:data' can be an item to act as the ONLY fuel for this recipe (no need to have a fuel recipe for the item!)
  And obviously '= material:data' is the result, this recipe type only supports 1 result type.
  
  <b>Examples:</b>
<div id="code">// smelt gold_ingot to ore
smelt
gold_ingot
= gold_ore

// glowstone and water bottle as fuel makes an exp bottle
smelt
glowstone % 20.5-30 // random cook time between 20.5 and 30 seconds
&amp; potion:water // fuel, 'water' data value from 'aliases.yml'
= exp_bottle</div>


<h3>FUEL RECIPE - furnace fuel</h3>
<div id="code">FUEL
material:data % time
...</div>

  Adds a fuel with the specified burn time.
  'time' is required and can be a float number or a range of float numbers separated by a dash.
  The '...' part means you can specify more than one item, they are all added just like individual fuel recipes.

  <b>Example:</b>
<div id="code">FUEL
sulphur % 0.75 // see 'advanced recipes.html' how to make this EXPLODE !
lantern % 20 // 'lantern' is alias for 'jack_o_lantern'</div>
